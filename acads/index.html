National critical infrastructures are ripe targets for cyber-attacks. At IIT Kanpur, leveraging the expertise in multiple areas of Computer Science and Engineering we initiated such a comprehensive program within our center for cyber-security. We have a multi-disciplinary national project to carry out research, training and education in cyber security of the national cyber space including information infrastructure, and other critical infrastructures such as banking, power grid, industrial manufacturing, defense tactical communication networks, and various information assets of the country. <p class="text-justify">Our approach is multi-pronged and multi-layer -- defense-in-depth strategy. Starting from crypto algorithms and protocols, side-channel proof crypto engineering to vulnerability analysis of systems and application layer software, network and web security, cloud security through virtual machine hardening, and use of machine learning for anomaly detection to fight persistent threats in the critical infrastructure. <p class="text-justify">Several cyber security research groups from IIT Bombay, IIT Kharagpur, ISI Kolkata, IIIT-Delhi, and MNIT, Jaipur have agreed to associate their research groups/centers with the proposed center. Exchanging faculty and study for short and long periods for collaborative research and pursuing problem specific funding together will be the modality of these associations. As a show case of the center's productivity, three specific problem areas have been identified -- solutions of which are being pursued and show cased to the highest levels of the government.

The CPS Group at the CSE Department of IIT Kanpur is working on developing principled approaches for robust implementation of cyber-physical systems. A cyber-physical system is a collection of interconnected computing devices interacting with the physical world to regulate its behavior. The group is working on several exciting problems in the area of CPS, more specifically in distributed multi-robot systems and internet-of-things. The focus of this group is to develop cyber-physical systems with correctness guarantee through the application of formal verification/synthesis techniques.
