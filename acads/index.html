          <p class="lead">Education at IIT Kanpur empowers the students with a critical thinking led approach, scientific temperament and knowledge in science, engineering, management and humanities fields to solve problems that challenge humanity. The globally acclaimed education prepares the students for rewarding and exciting careers. The excellent education has enabled the alumni to succeed in diverse fields.</p>

          <div class="row bs-examples">
            <div class="col-xs-8">
              <p>Starting from the 2011 batch, the branch change rules were liberalized with the removal of the CGPA restriction of 8.0 for branch change. Branch changes are now allowed if there is a vacancy in the department you wish to move to. Starting from my batch(2011 batch), students also have the flexibility to do a dual-major(which is equivalent to two B.Tech degrees, e.g.. B.Tech, EE with a major in CSE), a minor in another department as well as the traditional conversion to a dual-degree M.Tech/M.Sc course. You can customise course template to a large extent and have the luxury of as many as 6 open electives(in CSE, atleast), which could be courses from any department you like, including MBA courses. Thus, if say you want to go for an MBA, you can have an edge.</p>

                <li>
                  IITK offers a liberal undergraduate education, where knowledge of science and technology is part of a broader knowledge platform. A student has the choice of opting for more than 50% of courses outside of the student's chosen department. Of these a student can opt for more than 25% of courses that are in fields such as management and humanities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The student is therefore free to develop a wide knowledge base encompassing many disciplines. IITK recognizes an undergraduate degree as the start of a student's higher education learning and encourages the student to explore so that the student can know what to do next.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In its undergraduate education IITK has removed the artificial split between the two science streams of Physics, Chemistry &amp; Mathematics (PCM) and Physics, Chemistry &amp; Biology (PCB). This has been done by introducing life sciences courses for engineering students. This better meets the needs of society since greater interaction between the two streams is required to deliver the next generation of inventions and discoveries.

              <p>This group is working on the interdisciplinary area of intersection of vision with signal processing and robotics. Our research mostly focuses on:
    a)- Language and Vision: Human has the natural capability to describe the visual scenario using natural language also they can answer the question based on the visual scenario. While for machine, it is a great challenge to combine the vision with natural language processing. With recent advancement of deep learning, now it is possible to combine the NLP and vision. Here a lot of research are going on like Visual question answer, Image Caption, Dense captioning etc. that combine the NLP and Vision.
    b)- Facial Analysis: This group mainly focuses on - (i) facial analysis: predicting identity, emotions, intent from faces, (ii) human attributes prediction: the kind of clothes the person is wearing, the accessories the person is wearing, (iii) pose estimation, (iv) action/activity prediction etc.
    c)- Human Behavior Analysis: Human behaviour is inherently multimodal, and hence requires combining information from other modalities (speech or language, for example) with vision. Through the confluence of these techniques, our goal is to provide a quantitative understanding of individual, group and social human behaviour, in domains, such as media, education, and health etc.
    d)- Perception/Vision for Robotics: Today, robots are used to perform challenging tasks that were not possible few years ago because of limited computational and sensor resources. In order to perform these complex tasks, robots need to sense and understand the environment around them. Depending upon the task at hand, robots are often equipped with different sensors to perceive their environment. Two important categories of perception sensors mounted on a robotic platform are (i) Range Sensors — 3D/2D lidars, radars, sonars, etc. (ii) Cameras — perspective, stereo, omnidirectional, etc.
Our group welcomes any innovative idea and ready to explore the exciting areas that has prominent research impact. Every year our paper got accepted top tier conferences like CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NIPS, AAAI etc.

              <p>CSE@IIT Kanpur is one of the best place in India to work in complexity theory. This group works on the following specified research topics - Complexity of number theoretic problems, Cryptography, Space complexity of graph theoretic problems, quantum computation etc. This apart, we are always enthusiastic to explore new problems related to this area. Dr. Manindra Agrawal, Dr. Nitin Saxena and Dr. Neeraj Kayal won the prestigious "Godel" and "Fulkerson" prize for "AKS Primality Test".

              <p>With terrorist organizations (e.g. ISIS), and other adversaries abound, Cyber-Security is not just a computer science issue but a national security issue. National critical infrastructures are ripe targets for cyber-attacks. A comprehensive cyber-security research and technology transfer program is needed for India. All target systems require protection via detection of on-going cyber-attacks, attribution to sources, and prevention through preemption. Offensive cyber measures are also required. Cyber man power development is a national imperative. At IIT Kanpur, leveraging the expertise in multiple areas of Computer Science and Engineering we initiated such a comprehensive program within our center for cyber-security. We have a multi-disciplinary national project to carry out research, training and education in cyber security of the national cyber space including information infrastructure, and other critical infrastructures such as banking, power grid, industrial manufacturing, defense tactical communication networks, and various information assets of the country. Our approach is multi-pronged and multi-layer -- defense-in-depth strategy. Starting from crypto algorithms and protocols, side-channel proof crypto engineering to vulnerability analysis of systems and application layer software, network and web security, cloud security through virtual machine hardening, and use of machine learning for anomaly detection to fight persistent threats in the critical infrastructure. Several cyber security research groups from IIT Bombay, IIT Kharagpur, ISI Kolkata, IIIT-Delhi, and MNIT, Jaipur have agreed to associate their research groups/centers with the proposed center. Exchanging faculty and study for short and long periods for collaborative research and pursuing problem specific funding together will be the modality of these associations. As a show case of the center's productivity, three specific problem areas have been identified -- solutions of which are being pursued and show cased to the highest levels of the government .

              <p>In this age of automation, usage of complex safety-critical systems are increasingly high in industries like hardware, automobiles, avionics, space etc. This is a major task to ensure correctness and completeness to get a reliable controller of such systems. The CPS Group at the CSE Department of IIT Kanpur is working on developing principled approaches for robust implementation of cyber-physical systems. A cyber-physical system is a collection of interconnected computing devices interacting with the physical world to regulate its behavior. The group is working on several exciting problems in the area of CPS, more specifically in distributed multi-robot systems and internet-of-things. The focus of this group is to develop cyber-physical systems with correctness guarantee through the application of formal verification/synthesis techniques.
