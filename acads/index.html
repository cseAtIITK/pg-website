          <p class="lead">Education at IIT Kanpur empowers the students with a critical thinking led approach, scientific temperament and knowledge in science, engineering, management and humanities fields to solve problems that challenge humanity. The globally acclaimed education prepares the students for rewarding and exciting careers. The excellent education has enabled the alumni to succeed in diverse fields.</p>

            <div class="col-xs-8">
              <p>Starting from the 2011 batch, the branch change rules were liberalized with the removal of the CGPA restriction of 8.0 for branch change. Branch changes are now allowed if there is a vacancy in the department you wish to move to. Starting from my batch(2011 batch), students also have the flexibility to do a dual-major(which is equivalent to two B.Tech degrees, e.g.. B.Tech, EE with a major in CSE), a minor in another department as well as the traditional conversion to a dual-degree M.Tech/M.Sc course. You can customise course template to a large extent and have the luxury of as many as 6 open electives(in CSE, atleast), which could be courses from any department you like, including MBA courses. Thus, if say you want to go for an MBA, you can have an edge.</p>

                  IITK offers a liberal undergraduate education, where knowledge of science and technology is part of a broader knowledge platform. A student has the choice of opting for more than 50% of courses outside of the student's chosen department. Of these a student can opt for more than 25% of courses that are in fields such as management and humanities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The student is therefore free to develop a wide knowledge base encompassing many disciplines. IITK recognizes an undergraduate degree as the start of a student's higher education learning and encourages the student to explore so that the student can know what to do next.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In its undergraduate education IITK has removed the artificial split between the two science streams of Physics, Chemistry &amp; Mathematics (PCM) and Physics, Chemistry &amp; Biology (PCB). This has been done by introducing life sciences courses for engineering students. This better meets the needs of society since greater interaction between the two streams is required to deliver the next generation of inventions and discoveries.

              <p>With terrorist organizations (e.g. ISIS), and other adversaries abound, Cyber-Security is not just a computer science issue but a national security issue. National critical infrastructures are ripe targets for cyber-attacks. At IIT Kanpur, leveraging the expertise in multiple areas of Computer Science and Engineering we initiated such a comprehensive program within our center for cyber-security. We have a multi-disciplinary national project to carry out research, training and education in cyber security of the national cyber space including information infrastructure, and other critical infrastructures such as banking, power grid, industrial manufacturing, defense tactical communication networks, and various information assets of the country. <p>Our approach is multi-pronged and multi-layer -- defense-in-depth strategy. Starting from crypto algorithms and protocols, side-channel proof crypto engineering to vulnerability analysis of systems and application layer software, network and web security, cloud security through virtual machine hardening, and use of machine learning for anomaly detection to fight persistent threats in the critical infrastructure. <p>Several cyber security research groups from IIT Bombay, IIT Kharagpur, ISI Kolkata, IIIT-Delhi, and MNIT, Jaipur have agreed to associate their research groups/centers with the proposed center. Exchanging faculty and study for short and long periods for collaborative research and pursuing problem specific funding together will be the modality of these associations. As a show case of the center's productivity, three specific problem areas have been identified -- solutions of which are being pursued and show cased to the highest levels of the government.

The CPS Group at the CSE Department of IIT Kanpur is working on developing principled approaches for robust implementation of cyber-physical systems. A cyber-physical system is a collection of interconnected computing devices interacting with the physical world to regulate its behavior. The group is working on several exciting problems in the area of CPS, more specifically in distributed multi-robot systems and internet-of-things. The focus of this group is to develop cyber-physical systems with correctness guarantee through the application of formal verification/synthesis techniques.

          <h3 id="research-theory">Major Breakthrough in Theory</h3>
          <div class="row bs-examples">
            <div class="col-xs-12">
One of the major outstanding problems in the area of computational number theory was solved by one of the faculty member recently. The problem was whether a number could be tested for primality in polynomial time. This is considered one of the most important research results during last 15 year in the area of Theoretical Computer Science.

          <h3 id="research-smartcard">Smart Card Technology Development</h3>
          <div class="row bs-examples">
            <div class="col-xs-12">
A standard for smart card operating system has been developed which is used by the government of India for all their smart card based applications. A smart card operating system has also been implemented which is compliant to this standard. This technology is in the process of being commercialized.

          <h3 id="research-language">Language Technology</h3>
          <div class="row bs-examples">
            <div class="col-xs-12">
Development of Indian language technology has been one of the major activities at IIT Kanpur. Some path breaking contributions have been made in Indian language coding (ISCII), keyboard design, transliteration, OCR machine translation, Linux ware, NLP, Indian scripts on Linux, Web content creation and search. Some of our landmark achievement is: GIST multilingual technology, AGLABHARTI &amp; ANUBHARTI MACHINE aided translation strategies and popular web sites such as Gita-supersite.

          <h3 id="research-biometric">Biometric</h3>
          <div class="row bs-examples">
            <div class="col-xs-12">
Multipurpose Multimodal Human Identification System is being developed at IIT Kanpur. The primary aim is to design a robust system which is capable of handling problems like security, personal, verification/identification and other related applications. It consists of three modules-
weaker modules that contains least features, medium level module containing more features, while strong features module that is packed with most of the features. The various traits that are considered are Face, Iris, Signature, Fingerprints and Ear. Finally, these traits are integrated together to achieve the maximum reliability and accuracy.

          <h3 id="research-medical">Medical Application</h3>
          <div class="row bs-examples">
            <div class="col-xs-12">
The medical applications group supported by media lab Asia is developing a portable mobile model of printing healthcare delivery which uses ICT and digital devices to contact individual requiring medical attention with doctors who are remotely studies. The 'Sehat Saathi' software being developed will allow at the backend for diagnoses and treatment if real-time connectivity is not available them the patient is virtualized and the doctor give advice based the data gathered about the patient.

          <h3 id="research-wireless">Wireless </h3>
          <div class="row bs-examples">
            <div class="col-xs-12">
Wireless networking research aims at making telecom affordable to rural areas that cannot be served profitably by conventional wireless technologies. A large scale outdoor experiment is being conducted to assess viability of using IEEE 802.11 technology for this purpose. Work in progress includes: wireless networks monitoring, MAC and routing protocol design, and novel application for wireless networks. This is the largest outdoor multi-hop system anywhere in the country.
