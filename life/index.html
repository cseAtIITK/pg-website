          <h2 id="life">Student Culture</h2>
          <p class="lead">It’s a good place to meet like- minded people and learn and grow together. The campus community forms a close knit group and you make friends for life here. The campus, the people and this life has made a stronger and confident person.</p>

          <h3 id="life-clubs">Clubs</h3>
          <p>Interested in something? There will be a club for it. If there isn't one, you can open your own. (assuming, of course, that you get enough people interested in the same activity) More importantly, you don't have to approach a professor for opening a club, you just put up a proposal in front of the "Students' Gymkhana"(composed almost entirely of students in executive positions). If the Gymkhana approves it, you are done.
          </p>
          <h3 id="life-freedom">Freedom</h3>
          <p> If someone were to ask me what truly sets IIT Kanpur apart, my answer would be the freedom that the students are given and the trust that the authorities have in us. Starting from the very basic, there is no concept of an "in-time" in hostels, allowing students to pursue moonshots in different technical clubs or just goof around in the campus (or SAC, which has a food court which stays open until 4 am in the morning). The college festivals: Antaragni, Techkriti and Udghosh are planned and executed by the Core Teams (comprised entirely of students) at the behest of the Students' Gymkhana - which oversees all student activities. The Students' Senate is an empowered body which acts as a medium to convey the aspirations of students to the Institute authorities. Who in turn ensure that all decisions affecting the student body is taken only after careful consideration of the students opinions. Even the placements which requires a professional dialogue between multinational companies like Google, Microsoft etc is handled impeacably by the students.</p>
          <h3 id="life-liberty">Liberty</h3>
          <p>If there is anything such as a single defining feature of IIT-Kanpur, it is liberty. You don't have LAN bans, download limits, compulsory attendance (except in some courses where it is a small percentage (5-10%) of the overall course weightage), no fixed time by which you should be in the campus etc. There is no dress code (students frequently come to lectures, project demos etc. in tees and shorts). Boys are allowed in girls' hostels and vice-versa until 12AM, and you are free to go to your friend's room in such cases.</p>
          <h3 id="life-gymkhana">Students' Gymkhana</h3>
          <p>The entire environment is planned to give a conducive atmosphere for a holistic learning – to focus on the development of personality as a whole.The Student Gymkhana makes sure that the student leads a very active life when present in campus. It understand that the average student coming in has led a very monotonous life during the preparation days and feels he needs to diversify and wants to develop his personality as a whole. It makes sure that there is some thing in the campus from Cultural to Sports to Technical through one of the institute's pillar of strength.</p>

          <h3 id="residence-city">City Life</h3>
          <p>The appeal of Metro cities is alluring but is specious. Truth be told, at the end of four years, you won't remember whether you got that obligatory GPL on your birthday in a posh nightclub or in your dainty room, at the end of the day, it would be the people kicking your ass and their sadistic laughter that'll haunt you for the rest of your mortal life. But that being said, Kanpur fulfills my checklist of all the must haves for any decent city: all major motion pictures being released on time, good restaurants, a disco and a mall where you can see a couple of Carrera S's parked as if it's no big deal!</p>
          <p>I'm sure that you'd all be wondering what do we do in our free time if we don't have recourse to the simple pleasures of a metro city. The answer is quite simple - we don't have free time. IIT Kanpur is always bustling with activity, be it live screening of major matches or movie screenings in our badass Open Air Theater (or OAT in IITK parlance), inter hall competitions, club activities, preparations for college festivals (Antaragni, Techkriti, Udghosh), open mics, karaokes, acoustic nights, musical extravaganzas, dance performances, dramatics events and what not. The campus has a plethora of activities to cater to all kinds of people, from the adrenaline junkie to the lazy couch potato.</p>
          <h3 id="residence-food">Food</h3>
          <p>If you are one of those who has qualified after studying in Kota or some other remote corner of the country, where you had really bad food, your troubles are now over. Having lived in a Kota hostel, the food in my hostel was surprisingly better. What distinguishes IITK, however, is the fact that we have food available 22.5 hours of the day. Yes, there is only a short 1.5 hour period from 4AM to 5:30AM when you wouldn't be able to get any food. Until 2 AM, you would be able to get food in any of the hostel canteens and until 4AM, you would be able to get food at the food court, which serves fast food ranging from burgers, chats etc. to south indian food. We also have a CCD in our campus, right besides the library as well as a Dominoes in the OAT. You are completely spoilt for choice.</p>
          <h3 id="residence-halls">Halls of Residence</h3>
          <p>IIT Kanpur offer the most spacious hostels and largest rooms for the students along with 22 hours of eating facilities available in the campus ranging from some well known food chains to hostel canteens which are well-stocked and offer anyone a let out after a stressful day.Every hostel has a basketball court, few badminton courts, a volleyball court, table tennis room, a television room, a computer room, a reading room for newspaper, magazines, journals, etc, and a hall office to handle hostel affairs. The basketball and volleyball courts in the hostels are floodlit, enabling students to play even at night as the day is more or less jam packed with other activities.</p>
          <h3 id="residence-homly">Homly Environment</h3>
          <p>The halls of residences were built keeping in mind that they were to house the brightest. These weren't just the buildings that were laid brick by brick but, were supposed to be the homes of the students away from their home. They were meant to be witnesses to life long friendships, to be onlookers for ingenious ideas and to be the secure spot for the tired student to rest and re-energise for the upcoming days. All halls from I to XI have been named 'Halls of Residences' precisely with this motive in mind and are not just hostels for students. They provide 24*7 electricity , clean sanitation facilities and good quality food for the nourishment of its beloved residents. Long after one graduates, he/she fondly recollects the memories spent in these rooms which are a treasure for them.</p>
