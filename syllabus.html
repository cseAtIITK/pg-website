<p>Following are 3 groups of topics. In the admissions test, each candidate will be asked to answer questions from at least 2 groups of 

topics. Candidates who want to work in theoretical computer science must choose Group 1, candidates interested to work in 

Systems/Networks/Cyber Security must choose Group 2, and candidates interested in data mining, machine learning and data sciences must 

choose Group 3. Other group(s) can be chosen freely. </p>
