<h1 id="m.tech-admissions"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> M.Tech admissions</h1>
<h2 id="should-i-have-a-valid-gate-score-for-m.tech-admission"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Should I have a valid GATE score for M.Tech admission?</h2>
<p>Unless you are a sponsored or part-time student you do need a valid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Aptitude_Test_in_Engineering">GATE</a> score.</p>
<h2 id="i-am-a-final-year-b.tech-student-in-a-c.f.t.i.-do-i-require-gate"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> I am a final year B.Tech student in a C.F.T.I. Do I require GATE?</h2>
<p>At present the direct admission, i.e. without <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Aptitude_Test_in_Engineering">GATE</a>, is only for Ph.D admissions and not M.Tech admissions.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-syllabus-for-the-entrance-testinterview-at-iitk"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> What is the syllabus for the entrance test/interview at IITK?</h2>
<p>All candidates have to appear for written test and programming test. Based upon the result of written and programming tests, shortlisted candidates will be called for interview. </p>
<p>You can go to the following link to find the syllabus : <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/admissions/syllabus.html">Syllabus for the Tests</a>.
The tests have the syllabus similar to as that of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Aptitude_Test_in_Engineering">GATE</a> and involves basics in computer science and engineering.
<h2 id="is-there-a-fixed-number-of-candidates-who-are-selected"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Is there a fixed number of candidates who are selected?</h2>
<p>No. We have usually 30-40 students joining the M.Tech programme every year. However, we will select more candidates if we find them suitable, and likely to succeed in our PG programme.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-do-a-part-time-m.-tech"><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Can I do a part-time M. Tech?</h2>
<p>We rarely select part-time M. Tech students. We do not run special evening classes we feel it will be difficult for such candidates to succeed in our program.</p>
<h2 id="is-an-m.c.a.-eligible-to-apply-for-m.tech"><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Is an M.C.A. eligible to apply for M.Tech?</h2>

<dt>For M.Tech/M.E students:</dt>
<dd><p>If you have an M.Tech or M.E. degree in any discipline with minimum requirements from a recognized university, there is no need for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Aptitude_Test_in_Engineering">GATE</a>. This includes dual degrees (B.Tech-M.Tech dual) from places which offer this, like BITS Pilani. If you have doubts about whether your postgraduate degree is recognized, please contact (admissions at cse.iitk.ac.in). The minimum requirements are given in Section 2 of the <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/doaa/data/pgmanual-02Sep2015.pdf" title="PG Manual">PG Manual</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>For B.Tech, M.C.A. and M.Sc. Computer Science students (general):</dt>
<dd><p>For Ph.D students, we provide Ph.D scholarship against teaching assistance in the courses taught here. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Aptitude_Test_in_Engineering">GATE</a> score is necessary to obtain such a teaching assistanctship from the Ministry of Human Resources Development, Govt. of India. Note that this is technically <strong>not</strong> an admission requirement, but is practically relevant. Unlike M.Tech admission, Ph.D. admission has <strong>no cutoff</strong> for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Aptitude_Test_in_Engineering">GATE</a> score. We will select candidates based on their performance in our admission test and interview. The exact requirements are given in Section 2 of the <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/doaa/data/pgmanual-02Sep2015.pdf" title="PG Manual">PG manual</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Direct admission for final year B.Tech students:</dt>
<dd><p>Recently <a href="http://mhrd.gov.in/">M.H.R.D</a> approved teaching assistantship for admission of final year B.Tech students from any of the <a href="http://mhrd.gov.in/technical-education-1">CFTI</a>s. These candidates <em>need not</em> have a valid GATE score. You can apply to us either in the summer (usually some time in May) or in winter (usually in December). Once you have cleared our written test and interview you will be given a provisional admission. You will need a CPI of 7.5 at the time of qualifying to get this provisional admissions confirmed. For details consult the <a href="./announcements/2014-09-29-Direct-Admission-without-GATE/">announcement on our homepage</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-syllabusformat-for-the-testinterview-for-ph.d-candidates"><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> What is the syllabus/format for the written test/ programming test /interview for Ph.D candidates?</h2>
<p>All candidates have to appear for written test and programming test. Based upon the result of written and programming tests, shortlisted candidates will be called for interview. </p>
<p>You can go to the following link to find the syllabus : <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/admissions/syllabus.html">Syllabus for the Tests</a>.
<p>The tests have the syllabus similar to as that of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Aptitude_Test_in_Engineering">GATE</a> and involves basics in computer science and engineering. Although the interview is also based on the same syllabus, we would like to gauge the depth of understanding of the candidate. Often, you would be asked questions in specific topics which <em>you</em> are comfortable with or in areas that you want to work on for your Ph.D.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-a-fixed-number-of-candidates-who-will-be-selected"><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Is there a fixed number of candidates who will be selected?</h2>
<p>No. We will select all able candidates. What we are looking for are competent, motivated students who are highly likely to succeed our Ph.D programme.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-do-a-part-time-ph.d"><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Can I do a part-time Ph.D?</h2>

<p>There is a provision for a part-time Ph.D. You can go through the <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/doaa/DOAA/parttimestudents.htm">guidelines for part-time programme</a> and section 2.9 of the <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/doaa/data/pgmanual-02Sep2015.pdf">PG manual</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re selected after the test/interview, and want to do a part-time Ph.D, you have to do the following. There are 3 components for a Ph.D - coursework for about 2 years and a qualifying exam, and thesis work after that. During the time you take coursework and the qualifier, you have to attend classes during normal hours. (There are no evening classes, weekend classes etc. solely for part-time students.) This means that you will have to be on Campus during these 2 years.</p>
<p>Afterwards, during the thesis requirements, the institute specifies that the students be “local”. This is vague, and we will liberally interpret it — you can make an arrangement with your Ph.D guide about this.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-do-an-external-ph.d"><span class="header-section-number">3.7</span> Can I do an external Ph.D?</h2>
<p>Yes. You need to be working at your current institution for more than 2 years. You also need a written consent from your employer, relieving you from duties. Moreover, you need a person who can supervise you at <strong>your location outside IITK campus</strong>. If you don’t have someone of that sort, then you could try for a part-time Ph.D.</p>.
<p>Such students are selected through our test/interview. External Ph.D students need not have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Aptitude_Test_in_Engineering">GATE</a> score.</p>

<p>You can go through the <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/doaa/DOAA/externalstudents.htm">Guidelines for Admission to External Registration Programme</a> further details.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-external-and-part-time-ph.d"><span class="header-section-number">3.8</span> What is the difference between external and part-time Ph.D?</h2>
<p>External Ph.D was designed to be able to do a Ph.D from another academic, scientific or research institution. In effect, it means that you should be working at a location where at least one person is willing and <strong>able</strong> to supervise your Ph.D work.</p>
<p>Part-time Ph.D can be done by a person who is currently working in a setting where (s)he need not have any Ph.D guide - for example, in the industry.</p>
<h2 id="is-an-m.c.a.-eligible-to-apply-for-ph.d"><span class="header-section-number">3.9</span> Is an M.C.A. eligible to apply for Ph.D?</h2>
<p>Yes. Please see the question on <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Aptitude_Test_in_Engineering">GATE</a> score</em> for details.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-does-a-ph.d-take"><span class="header-section-number">3.10</span> How long does a Ph.D take?</h2>
<p>It really depends. You have to spend time to finish the coursework and qualifiers, which takes about 2 years.</p>
<p>The typical duration for a Ph.D degree is about 5 years. But students have graduated with a Ph.D degree from the CSE department in around 3 years.</p>
<p>Unlike any other degree that you do, a Ph.D degree does not have a fixed duration, or a predefined outcome. It depends on a willingness to explore, and to do research at the highest level. There is no minimum period you have to spend, just a level of quality and productivity that you have to meet.</p>

<h2 id="where-do-i-stay"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Where do I stay?</h2>
<p>We will arrange the accommodation for you.</p>
<h2 id="do-i-need-to-bring-anything-with-me-other-than-the-certificates"><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Do I need to bring anything with me other than the certificates?</h2>
<p>For the test/interviews held during winter consider bringing warm clothes, blankets etc. Kanpur can get quite cold during the month of December.</p>
